# Hand Gesture Recognition for System Volume Control

This script allows you to control the system volume using hand gestures recognized by a computer vision model. It uses the MediaPipe library for hand tracking and a pre-trained model for gesture recognition.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or above
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- MediaPipe
- TensorFlow
- Keras

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
2. Install the required packages:
    pip install opencv-python numpy mediapipe tensorflow keras

3. Download the pre-trained gesture recognition model and class names file and place them in the project directory.

4. Connect a webcam to your system.

## Usage

1. Run the script:
    python hand_gesture_volume_control.py
2. The script will start capturing the video from the webcam and display the output frame.

3. Hold your hand in front of the webcam and perform the following gestures:

    * Thumbs Up: Increases the system volume.
    * Thumbs Down: Decreases the system volume.
Note: Make sure your system has audio capabilities and the necessary audio drivers are installed for volume control to work properly.


## Troubleshooting
* If the script fails to capture frames from the webcam, make sure the webcam is connected and functional.
* If the hand landmarks are not detected accurately, try adjusting the min_detection_confidence parameter in the script to a lower value.
